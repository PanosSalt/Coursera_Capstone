    "### 1.1 Scenario and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I just started working as an Application Support Engineer although my real passion is to find a job and work as a data scientist. I currently live within walking distance from \"Megaro Mousikis metro station\" near the center of Athens therefore I have access to good public transportation to work. Likewise, I enjoy many amenities in the neighborhood , such as international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. Although you don' t really care about my personal life I have just recently started looking for a bigger house in order to live with my girlfriend and start a family. Although, I am very excited about it, I am a bit stressed towards the process to secure a comparable place to live in Athens, since there is a significant raise in rental prices within the last few years. Therefore, I decided to apply the skills I have learned during studying for the Coursera courses to explore ways to make sure my decision is factual and rewarding. Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but it will be rather rewarding doing it myself with the tools used so far."

Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations. Create a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radius of 1.5 km around each subway station. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area."
